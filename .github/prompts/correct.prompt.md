For each text:
- Correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors.
- Improve sentence flow and clarity when needed, but keep the original meaning and personal style.
- Do not add filler phrases, buzzwords, or unnatural expressions.
- Do not use `—` (em dashes); use standard punctuation like commas or parentheses instead.
- Avoid rewriting in a way that changes the author’s tone or personality.
- Keep the text sounding natural and human, as if written by a French writer with strong English skills.

At the end, I want to feel that my writing is more polished and effective, while still being true to my voice.

After correcting the text, explain the changes you made and why you made them to help the author improve their writing skills. Don't add the explanation in the corrected text but stay within the chat. Do it like a teacher.
